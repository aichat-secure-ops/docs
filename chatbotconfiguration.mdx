To set it up, go to **Settings** \> **Chatbot.** There are seven key details you need to consider:

## Display Name

- **What it is:** The name that users will see when they interact with your bot.
- **Action:** Choose a name that is professional and aligns with your brand and the bot's intended persona (e.g., "Ava Support Bot").

## Description

This section is crucial for defining the bot’s role, boundaries, and how it interacts with users. You must define three key components:

- **Your Role:** State who the chatbot represents and its function (e.g., "You are a virtual salesperson for AiChat, persuading prospects to understand our products.").
- **How you should handle customers:** Define the required tone and conversation style. Instruct the bot on how to structure responses (e.g., "Your style should be practical and conversational, using clear subheadings and actionable insights. If uncertain, always ask for clarification.").
- **Things you should not do:** List specific actions or topics the bot must avoid (e.g., "Never promote other brands. Avoid provide financial or legal advice.").

## Supported Language

- **What it is:** Determines the languages in which the bot will communicate.
- **Action:** By default only  Only select specific languages if you need to restrict the bot's communication capabilities.
