## Conversation Analytics

This section enables tracking of the volume of interaction and the efficiency of the chatbot across a selected period.

To view data for a specific period, you can select a date range from predefined options like **Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, This Week, This Month, Last Month, Last 3 Months, or Last 6 Months**. Alternatively, you can set a **custom range** by manually selecting start and end dates from the calendar. This feature helps analyze chatbot performance and user interactions within a desired timeframe for better trend analysis and optimization.

### Key Metrics:

- **Total Interactions**: Showing how many conversations were handled by the chatbot. The low count means it might not be visible or its engagement with users is poor.
- **Total Messages**: Total number of messages sent and received to help determine how engaging is the chatbot.
- **Average Messages per Chat**: A measure of how long the average chat is. A higher number could indicate complex queries or unnecessary back-and-forth responses.

This section offers a heat map containing interaction times, as well as daily conversation volume, so you can see what are the busiest hours of your chatbot.
