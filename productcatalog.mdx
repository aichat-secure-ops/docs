The Product Catalog lets you show your products inside the chatbot so customers can easily browse and interact with your offering.

Use the catalog when your chatbot needs to:

- **Suggest Products:** Recommend items based on customer requests.
- **Compare Products:** Show features side-by-side to help with decisions.

This improves the shopping experience by making product discovery easier. 

_Note: our catalogue provides a more meaningful structured way for AI to understand your product information vs crawling products directly from your website. You can use product catalogue for any types of products, including events, promotions._

# How to Access

1. Go to **Product Catalog** in the left-side menu.
2. The dashboard shows your product list with details like **Name, SKU, Status, Tags, Price, and Date Created**. _(Note: The list is empty until you add products.)_

## How to Import Products (via CSV)

1. Click the green **Import CSV** button (top right).
2. A pop-up window will open.
3. **Download the sample file** first to ensure your file has the correct format.
4. Upload your CSV file:
   - Drag and drop the file.
   - _OR_ Click **Browse Files** and select it.
5. _(Optional)_ Enter your website's **URL handle** to link to product details.
6. Select the **Currency**.

Click **Import CSV**.

**Product Display & Recommendations**\
After you upload your product catalog, the items will appear in the system. The chatbot will then use customer questions to recommend products, showing users what's available and relevant.
