### **When Should Businesses Connect a WhatsApp Number for a Chatbot?**

Businesses should consider connecting their WhatsApp number to a chatbot when:

- **WhatsApp is their primary communication channel**

If most customer inquiries or service requests come through WhatsApp, automating responses can improve efficiency and reduce response time.

- **They receive a high volume of repetitive queries**

A chatbot can handle FAQs like business hours, product availability, order tracking, or pricing — freeing up human agents for more complex issues.

- **They want to offer 24/7 customer support**

A WhatsApp chatbot can provide immediate responses even outside business hours, improving customer satisfaction and reducing missed inquiries.

- **They aim to scale customer support without increasing headcount**

Chatbots allow businesses to manage more conversations simultaneously, which is ideal during campaigns or peak seasons.

- **They are running marketing or promotional campaigns via WhatsApp**

Integrating a chatbot ensures quick follow-up, lead qualification, and better conversion tracking.

- **They serve customers in regions where WhatsApp is widely used**

In many countries, WhatsApp is the default messaging app. Providing support on the platform customers already use creates a more seamless experience.

 

## **How to Connect Your WhatsApp Number to the Chatbot**

### **Step 1: Create a Business Portfolio on Meta**

Before connecting your WhatsApp number, you must have a Meta Business Portfolio.

1. Visit the [Meta Business Settings page](https://business.facebook.com/latest/settings/business_info?business_id=658528453763980).
2. Log in with your Facebook account.
3. Set up your **Business Info**:
   - Business Name
   - Legal name and address
   - Business email and website (if applicable)

### **Step 3: Verify your Meta Business Portfolio**

Verification is required to access WhatsApp Business API.

Business verification is only needed after your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) is created, or if you haven't completed it before.

1. In **Meta Business Settings**, go to **Business Info**.
2. Go to the Security Centre, and click **Start Verification**.
3. Complete the verification flow by selecting a country and business type, adding business details, and you can input your preferred verification contact method.
4. Once submitted, Meta typically reviews within 1–5 business days. Check your verification status in Business Settings.

### **Step 4: Managing Your WhatsApp Integration in AiChat**

Once your WhatsApp Business Account is successfully integrated with AiChat, you can manage and customize your WhatsApp chatbot settings directly from the dashboard.

### 4.2 Default Messaging Settings

These settings help set expectations and streamline customer engagement.

### 4.3 WhatsApp Performance Dashboard

The **WhatsApp Performance** section allows you to monitor key chatbot metrics:

Use these metrics to fine-tune your flows and improve chatbot performance.

### 4.4 Disconnecting WhatsApp Integration

You’ll also find a **Disable WhatsApp Integration** option. If selected:

- Your WhatsApp Business Account will be disconnected from the chatbot.
- The chatbot will no longer send or receive messages on WhatsApp.
- You can reconnect your WhatsApp Business Account at any time to resume sending and receiving messages through the chatbot.
- **Note:** AiChat only allows one phone number to be connected at a time. If you wish to change the phone number, you must first disconnect the existing one and then reconnect with the new number.
