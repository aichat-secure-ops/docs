## Widget Customization

Setting up widget involves two key steps: **customization settings** and **installation settings**. To set it up, go to **Settings** \> **Channels**.

The customization setting allows you to define your bot personality including theme, text color, avatar, and initial greeting. These settings will be displayed on the bot widget during user interactions.

### Visual Customization (Theme, Brand Color, Text Color, Avatar)

Customize your bot’s appearance by selecting visual settings that align with your brand identity. To adjust your widget’s appearance, navigate to **Channels**, where you'll find a list of customization options:

- **Theme:** Choose between **Basic** and **Sleek**. The **Basic** theme keeps the bot avatar inside the header, while the **Sleek** theme places it outside the header with a larger display.
- **Brand Color:** Pick a header color palette that best represents your brand.
- **Text Color:** Select between **Light** (white text) and **Dark** (black text) for better readability.
- **Avatar:** Your avatar will serve as the bot’s image and icon on your company website. Use the default AiChat avatar by selecting **"Use Provided Avatar"**, or upload a custom one by clicking **Add Avatar.**

### Initial Message Customization (Header Title, Subtitle, Welcome Message, Placeholder)

Customize the initial message that appears on your bot's landing page, including the header title, header subtitle, welcome message, and placeholder message.

- **Header Title**: Set a greeting message along with your bot’s unique name.
- **Header Subtitle**: Add a short, engaging message such as _"Here to help you"_, _"What can I do to assist you?"_, or _"I’d be happy to help with your queries."_
- **Welcome Message**: Craft a warm and inviting message tailored to your target audience.
- **Placeholder Message**: Enter a brief text to be displayed in the chatbot's input field, guiding users on what to type.

### Starters (Quick Access Shortcuts)

Starters work as quick-access shortcuts, making it easier for users to communicate with your bot.  They are displayed at the front of your landing widget page for easy interaction.

<Tip>
  Frequently asked topics or important prompts that users are likely to seek can be highlighted to starters.

## Widget Installation

### Allowed Domains

You can specify a list of websites that will display the web widget. This ensures no one can 'hijack' the script and use on websites other than the approved ones by you even if they were to place the installation script on unapproved websites.

### Adding Website Domains

Enter the website domains where you would like to activate the chatbot by clicking **Add**.
