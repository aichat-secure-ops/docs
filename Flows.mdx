## When to Create a Custom Flow

Custom flows are ideal for automating specific business processes:

1. **Lead Generation Submission:** Use a **Collect Node** to gather user information (e.g., name, email) and an **Action Node** (HTTP API or Email) to send the data to a CRM or lead management system like HubSpot.
2. **Leave a Message or Contact Us:** Collect customer details using a **Collect Node** when a Live Agent is unavailable, ensuring your customer service team can follow up later.

## Steps to Create and Design a Flow

The key components of a conversation flow follow a standard pattern: **Trigger** → **Action (Collect/Branch/Message)** → **Send Information (Action Node)**.

### Create the Flow

1. Log in to the AiChat platform.
2. Navigate to the **Flows** tab in the side navigation menu.
3. Click the **“Create Flow”** button.
4. Input a clear **Flow Name** and **Description** for easy identification.

Click **“Create”** to open the flow canvas.

The Trigger defines when the chatbot will initiate the flow.

1. Click **“Add Trigger”**.
2. Input a maximum of five user **Trigger Phrases** (variations of the same user intent, e.g., "I want to leave a message," "Contact us," "Send a note").
3. Close the edit panel to save the configuration.

## Add Nodes (Building Blocks)

**Nodes determine how the conversation progresses.**

### **Message Node**

- **Purpose:** Defines the bot's communication with the user.
- **Key Configuration Details:**
  - **Type:** Supports text, quick reply buttons, and media.
  - **Text:** Use for confirmations or thank-you messages (e.g., "Thank you for your inquiry.").
  - **Dynamic Response:** Use smart rephrasing for unique responses.

### **Collect Node**

- **Purpose:** Captures specific user details, functioning like an online form.
- **Key Configuration Details:**
  - **Field Name & Type:** Define the variable and data type (e.g., _email_, _date_).
  - **Mapping:** Option to map the answer to the user profile.
  - **Validation:** Set if the field is mandatory.
  - **Prompt:** Customize the bot's message (e.g., "Please enter your check-in date").
  - To add more fields, select **"Add Field."** 

To confirm the user's input, select the **"Replay the options to the visitor"** checkbox

### **Action Node - Email**

Purpose: sends email to target recipients.  Email originates from AiChat's no reply email address. Input recipient emails, subject, and body. Must define separate paths for **Success** and **Failure** of the email delivery.

- You can personalise email Subject and the Body content by using placeholders x.  Attributes from conversation profile will be used to personalise the email's content.

### Action Node - HTTP API

\*\*Purpose: \*\*Used for API calls (e.g., sending data to a CRM). Provide the API endpoint, method (e.g., POST), and body (e.g., JSON). Must define separate paths for **Success** and **Failure** of the API call.

- The most important part is in the API request where you must provide the API endpoint that should be called by the AI Agent to retrieve data to send updates.
- You can use any RESTFul API standards; GET, POST, PATCH, PUT and DELETE.
- You can also include Basic or Bearer token under Authorization Headers if required, and add other header options.

Once you submit the API endpoint, you can test to call the API. If it’s working you can save by closing the edit panel. You need to make sure to add unique responses for both successful and unsuccessful API calls, similar to the email action setup.

### **Branch Node**

- **Purpose:** Branches the flow based on specified conditions (user profile data, collected data, etc.).
- **Key Configuration Details:**
  - **Conditions:** Define criteria using pre-defined or custom logic (e.g., user_phone_number is not empty).
  - **Multiple Branches:** Define different paths and responses for each condition met.

## Save & Publish

Once satisfied with the flow structure and node configurations, click the **“Save & Publish”** button. This action makes your flow live and available to users.

\
**In Conclusion:** Flow Builder enhances user engagement and streamlines business processes. Begin with simple flows, like lead collection, and gradually build complexity using conditional branches and powerful action nodes to create tailored conversational experiences.
