    In this step, you will manage and personalize your own bot to reflect your brand and communcation style. There are seven key details you need to consider:

    1. **Display Name**

    The name will be visible to users during interactions with the bot. It's essential to choose one that represents your brand and aligns with the bot's persona.

    1. **Description**

    This section allows you to define your chatbot’s role, outlining what it is designed to do and how it interacts with users. The description should be concise yet informative summary of your chatbot's purpose, functionality, tone, and the type of services it offers.

    1. **Domain Strictness**

       Choose a specific domain for your bot to determine its response style. There are three levels of domain strictness available:
       - **Flexible** – Responds to prompts beyond its predefined knowledge scope.
       - **Moderate** – Politely declines requests that fall outside its knowledge domain.
       - **Strict** – Stricly refuses any prompts unrelated to its designated knowledge scope.

       Additional Guidelines**

    Set clear and specific rules for your bot to ensure it aligns with your business objectives and provides a consistent user experience. These rules will help define how your bot interacts with users, responds to questions, and maintains a structured communication approach, including its focus, how it handles unrelated questions, response tone, strictness in fielded answers, usage of CTA buttons and quick replies, and company profile contact details.

    There are no word limits in this section, allowing you to provide as much detail as needed.
