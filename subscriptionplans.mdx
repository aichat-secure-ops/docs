## Upgrading your account

- You can upgrade tier at any time from Free or any Paid plan.
- If you are upgrading from a paid tier to a higher tier (e.g. from SOLO to TEAM), we will pro-rate you the current plan and use the difference to offset the higher plans' price.
- You will also start a new billing cycle starts on date of purchase which provides a new set of conversation credits based on the newly purchased plan.

## Downgrading your account

- You can downgrade at anytime
- Your new plan will activate in the next billing cycle, including newly adjust monthly conversation credits.
- If you are on annual payment mode, the new plan will activate at the end of the annual billing cycle

### Cancelling your subscription plan

- You can cancel your plan at anytime
