**1\. Have a Robust Knowledge Base**

Comprehensive and Up-to-Date Content: The accuracy of your chatbot's responses largely depends on the quality of the data sources you provide. Ensure that any websites or PDFs you upload contain clear, readable text. Additionally, keep your knowledge base—comprising indexed materials such as websites, documents, text snippets, and Q&A—regularly updated with the latest information about your products, services, and FAQs.

Expand Coverage: Incorporate out-of-scope questions into the knowledge base to address gaps and improve the chatbot's ability to handle diverse queries.
