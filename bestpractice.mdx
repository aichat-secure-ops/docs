**Build a Robust Knowledge Base**

- Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date content: The accuracy of your chatbot's responses depends on high-quality data sources. Ensure that uploaded websites or PDFs contain clear, readable text. Keep your knowledge base updated with indexed materials such as websites, documents, text snippets, and Q&A to reflect the latest information about your products, services, and FAQs.
- Expand Coverage: Identify and incorporate out-of-scope questions into the knowledge base to address gaps and improve the chatbot's ability to handle diverse queries.

**Track and Optimize Performance**

- Use the AiChat dashboard to track response rates, customer satisfaction, and conversion rates, identifying opportunities for improvement.

By following these best practices, you can maximize the value of AiChat’s platform, build stronger customer relationships, and drive better business outcomes.
