# 1. Knowledge Base Content Guidelines

Before indexing any data, ensure your source materials adhere to the following principles:

## Clarity and Readability

- **Simple Language:** Use straightforward terminology. Avoid overly complex jargon unless absolutely necessary and clearly defined.
- **Structured Formatting:** Utilize headings, bullet points, and numbered lists within your source documents (e.g., PDFs, website content). This improves readability for both human users and the chatbot's indexing process.
- **Note**: images containing text cannot be extracted by our bot

## Comprehensiveness and Accuracy

- **Cover Key Topics:** Ensure the knowledge base covers all major aspects of your products, services, policies, and frequently asked questions.
- **Up-to-Date Information:** Regularly review and update your source content to maintain accuracy. Outdated information leads to poor chatbot performance and user frustration.
- **Internal Consistency:** Verify that information across different documents or sections does not contradict itself.

# 2. Supported Data Sourcing Methods

Our AiChat platform supports indexing information from multiple source types to build a robust knowledge base:

| Data Source                         | Description                                                           | Best Use Case                                                                         |
| :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Website Crawl (URL)**             | Indexing content directly from specified public web pages or domains. | Dynamic content, detailed product documentation, or broad site-wide information.      |
| **Documents**                       | Uploading and indexing content from PDF, Word and CSV files.          | Policy documents, user manuals, long-form guides, or technical specifications.        |
| **Text Snippets**                   | Manually entering short pieces of text directly into the platform.    | Specific definitions, disclaimers, or information not yet captured in other formats.  |
| **Q&A Pairs (Question and Answer)** | Structuring information as specific question-and-answer pairs.        | Addressing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) that require precise, defined responses. |

## Crawling Websites

Indexing a Website (Crawl)

1. Go to the **Knowledge Base** tab in the left-hand menu.
2. Click on **Websites**.

Adding a New Data Source

1. Click the **"Add Website"** button.
2. Enter the main URL you want the chatbot to learn from (e.g., [https://www.yourcompany.com/]

Toggle **“Sync Subpages”** to automatically sync all pages under the same URL path you provided (if needed). Advanced Settings allow you to add extra URLs to be included or exclude pages using glob expressions (e.g., /\*).

![Syncing your web page](/Syncingyourwebpage.gif)

You can monitor and manage your submitted sites:

- **Search and Filter:** Quickly find sites by searching or filtering by processing status (e.g., Indexed, Failed).
- **Last Synced At:** Shows the time of the most recent data update from the website.

#### Website Statuses Explained

| **Status**     | **Description**                                                                          |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processing** | The chatbot is currently extracting and analyzing content from the website.              |
| **Indexed**    | Content has been successfully integrated and is now used by the chatbot for responses.   |
| **Failed**     | An error occurred. Check the URL format and access permissions, then re-add the website. |

**Benefit:** Integrating websites ensures your chatbot uses the latest company information, FAQs, and product details without manual data updates.

### Crawling Website FAQ

<Accordion title="My sub-pages are not crawled" icon="sparkles">
  **If you're crawling subpages on a website but only one page is being crawled despite expecting multiple under the URL path, check the following:**

  - **Geo-Blocking Restrictions:** Does your website have geo-blocking enabled? If our crawlers are outside your allowed geo-location countries, they may be unable to access your site or may be redirected to a fallback page.
  - **Asynchronous JavaScript or Single-Page Application (SPA):** Does your website rely on asynchronous JavaScript or an SPA framework? If so, content may not be fully loaded when our crawlers attempt to access it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The bot is not responding with knowledge from crawled pages" icon="sparkles">
  **Your webpage's content may not be set up correctly for crawling.**

  1. **Image-Based Content:** If your webpage contains only images, our crawler may not be able to extract information, as it currently supports text-based content.
  2. **JavaScript Rendering:** If your webpage uses scripts to render content after our crawler has loaded the page, some content may not be captured.

  You can upload this content as documents or text snippets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to crawl pages that are localised to different languages?" icon="sparkles">
  Our bot does not require the same knowledge in different languages, as we can translate it into the customer's language. However, if the content differs by language, please crawl the specific pages so our bot can recognize the differences. You can exclude localized pages using the 'Exclude' feature under Advanced Settings.
</Accordion>

## **Uploading Documents**

The Documents feature allows you to upload and extract content from files, helping the chatbot respond accurately based on structured knowledge. This is useful for handling policy documents, product manuals, long-form guides, and other reference materials.

![Adding Documents](/images/AddingDocuments.gif)

1. **Access the Documents Section**\
   Under the dashboard, go to the **Knowledge Base** tab from the left-hand menu. Click on Documents to access the document management page.
2. **Upload a Document for Chatbot Knowledge**
   - Click the **"Add Document"** button.
   - Select a file (supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV.).

| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Processing** | The chatbot is analyzing the document content.                                                                                              |
| **Indexed**    | The document data is successfully added and available for chatbot responses.                                                                |
| **Failed**     | An issue occurred during indexing. Check the file format or content and ensure it is not password-protected before attempting to re-upload. |

By integrating document-based knowledge, you ensure that your chatbot provides accurate and well-structured responses based on official company materials.
