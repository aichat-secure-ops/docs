title: "Setting Up Your Knowledge Base"
description: "Building a well-structured knowledge base is essential for your chatbot, as it serves as the central repository of information for your company or organization. Ensure that all content is clear, readable, and comprehensive so the chatbot can accurately understand user inquiries and provide relevant responses. Our platform supports data indexing from websites, PDFs, text snippets, and Q&A to enhance your chatbot’s intelligence."

**Indexing a Website**

Your website is often the primary source of information for making your chatbot smarter. To add a website:

- Click “**Add Website**” and enter the main URL (e.g., [_https://www.aichat.com/_](https://www.aichat.com/)).
- Toggle “**Sync Subpages**” to automatically sync all pages under the same domain.
- In **Advanced Settings**, you can:


- Add specific URLs to be included in addition to the main URL.
- Use glob expressions (e.g., /\*) to exclude all pages that begin with a certain prefix.

By default, the platform syncs pages every 72 hours. The indexing status will be displayed as Started, Completed, or Failed to keep you informed.

**Uploading Documents**

You can add relevant documents for indexing in the system:

- Click **“Add Document”** and upload files in supported formats (.pdf, .doc, .docx).
- Ensure each file is within the **10 MB** size limit.
- After uploading, check the indexing status, which may show **Processing, Indexed, or Failed**.

**Using Text Snippets**

Text snippets allow you to add or update content instantly. They are useful for last-minute additions or time-sensitive information and make it easy to remove outdated content when needed. You can also check the indexing status, which may show **Processing, Indexed, or Failed**.

**Managing Q&A**

The **Q&A** section lets you upload question-answer pairs in bulk using a **CSV** file. You may also use the 'Add Q&A' option for manual entry. This is ideal for defining precise chatbot responses to specific queries rather than relying on data crawling from websites, documents, or text snippets. You can also check the indexing status, which may show **Processing, Indexed, or Failed**.

By effectively managing your knowledge base, you can optimize your chatbot’s performance and ensure users receive accurate, helpful responses.
