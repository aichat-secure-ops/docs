1. **Enabling Agent Handoff**

- Navigate to Support Operations in the AiChat dashboard.
- Toggle the Enable agent handoff option to activate handoff functionality.
- Enter the Customer Support Email Address where notifications will be sent.
- Click Save to apply the changes.
- Click Goto handoff flow to configure the flow.

1. **Configuring the Agent Handoff Flow**

**2.1 Flow Overview**

The Agent Handoff Flow is triggered when a user requests to speak with a human agent. The process includes:

- Detecting user intent to transfer.
- Collecting user information.
- Sending an email notification.
- Displaying confirmation messages to the user.

**2.2 Steps in the Flow**

**Step 1: Trigger the Flow**

The flow is activated when a visitor uses predefined phrases such as:

- "I want to talk to an agent."
- "Can I speak with a representative?"
- "Need help from a real person."
- "Let me chat with a human agent."

**Step 2: Collect User Information**

The chatbot gathers the following details:

- Name (Text input)
- Email (Email input)
- Phone Number (Phone input)
- Reason for contacting support (Text input)

Additional fields can be added if required.

**Step 3: Send Email Notification**

- The system sends an email to the customer support team with the collected user details.
- If the email is successfully sent, the user receives a confirmation message.
- If the email fails, an alternative message is displayed to inform the user.

**Step 4: Provide User Feedback**

- A message is sent to inform the user that support has been contacted.
- If an issue occurs, the chatbot provides an error message and suggests alternative solutions.

1. **Publishing the Flow**

- Review the flow in the builder.
- Click Save & Publish to activate the changes.
- Ensure the handoff process is tested for smooth functionality.

1. **Best Practices**

- Use Clear Triggers: Ensure that user intents are well-defined to avoid false handoffs.
- Collect Essential Information Only: Asking for too much information may lead to drop-offs.
- Monitor and Optimize: Regularly check handoff performance and adjust the flow as needed.
- Ensure Reliable Email Delivery: Test email notifications to ensure they reach the support team.

By properly setting up the Agent Handoff Flow, you ensure that chatbot interactions seamlessly escalate to human agents when required, enhancing customer satisfaction and support efficiency.
