# Manage Your Account

After verifying all details, click **Save** to confirm your changes.

## Personalize Your Chatbot

In this step, you will manage and personalize your own bot to reflect your brand and communication style. There are seven key details you need to consider:

### 1. Display Name

The name will be visible to users during interactions with the bot. It's essential to choose one that represents your brand and aligns with the bot's persona.

![/images/displayname.png\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/displayname.png)

### 2. Description

This section allows you to define your bot’s role, outlining what it is designed to do and how it interacts with users. The description should be concise yet informative summary of your bot's purpose, functionality, tone, and the type of services it offers.

![/images/description1.png\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/description1.png)

Below is an example of how you can define bot description:

<Tip>
  You are a virtual employee of AiChat acting as a salesperson to persuade prospects speaking to you. Your style should be practical and conversational. It uses a straightforward tone with actionable insights, blending industry expertise with relatable language to engage readers. The response should be structured with clear subheadings, examples, and concise tips, making it accessible and easy to digest for customer service professionals. It should also be a bit casual.
</Tip>

### 3. Default Language

Select the primary language in which your bot will communicate. This ensures that interactions remain consistent and accessible to your target audience.

![/images/defaultlanguage.png\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/defaultlanguage.png)

<Info>
  A multilingual option will be available, if your bot supports multiple languages.
</Info>

### 4. Domain Strictness

Choose a specific domain for your bot to determine its response style. There are three levels of domain strictness available:

- **Flexible** – Responds to prompts beyond its predefined knowledge scope.
- **Moderate** – Politely declines requests that fall outside its knowledge domain.
- **Strict** – Stricly refuses any prompts unrelated to its designated knowledge scope.

### ![/images/domainstrictness.png\+\_existingInIndexedDbMintlify](/images/domainstrictness.png)

### 5. Additional Guidelines

Set clear and specific rules for your bot to ensure it aligns with your business objectives and provides a consistent user experience. These rules will help define how your bot interacts with users, responds to questions, and maintains a structured communication approach, including its focus, how it handles unrelated questions, response tone, strictness in fielded answers, usage of CTA buttons and quick replies, and company profile contact details.

<Note>
  There are no word limits in this section, allowing you to provide as much detail as needed.
</Note>
